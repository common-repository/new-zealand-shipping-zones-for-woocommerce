== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What shipping zones will be added? =

Four new shipping zones are added:

* North Island (Rural)
* South Island (Rural)
* North Island
* South Island

= What happens if a shipping zone already exists? =

No existing shipping zone will be overwritten. For example, if a shipping zone called North Island was created before the plugin is activated:

* the existing North Island shipping zone will remain untouched
* three new shipping zones will be created: North Island (Rural), South Island (Rural), and South Island.

= Why is the shipping cost not displaying in the cart/checkout? =

At least one shipping method must be set for the shipping zone. Please see WooCommerce's [Flat Rate Shipping](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/) tutorial for an example of how to apply a shipping method.

= Why have zone names been added without regions? =

Your web server must have `allow_url_fopen` enabled to retrieve the region data. Please contact your webhost if you're unsure how to check this.

= Is the order of the zones important? =

Yes, the rural shipping zones must appear above the standard ones in the Zone name column.

= Are shipping zones removed if the plugin is removed? =

No, deactivating or deleting the plugin will not remove the shipping zones. Shipping zones can be manually removed via WooCommerce > Shipping > Shipping Zones.

= Why did my zone regions for North Island and South Island shipping zones disappear? =

Region codes were updated in the [WooCommerce 7.1.0 release](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/35011). Shipping zones configured with this plugin prior to the WooCommerce 7.1.0 release are no longer recognised by WooCommerce.

The easiest solution is to manually reassign the correct regions for the North Island and South Island zones.
